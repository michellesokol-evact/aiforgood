                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>We're at an inflection point in artificial intelligence â€“ presenting both tremendous potential opportunity and risk for people in developing countries. Rather than allowing the poverty gap to expand, poor countries have an opportunity to leapfrog development milestones with AI-powered innovations.</p>

                <p>Recognizing the rapid pace of innovation on AI models, we're launching an organization to ensure the meaningful benefits of AI reach the 3.5 billion people living in poverty globally.</p>

            <section id="context" class="section">
                <h2>Context</h2>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>We're at an inflection point in global development and AI â€“ the next two years may have an outsized effect on the next century of impact.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Current Landscape</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Today's AI applications predominantly focus on the developed world.</strong> Access and applications in the developing world have been largely neglected - only a small set of actors are driving forward action, little funding has been allocated, and more nuanced pilots are often small-scale and bespoke.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI models are rapidly progressing.</strong> Dario Amodei predicts AI models may surpass human capabilities "in almost everything" within 2-3 years, while McKinsey has reported its potential to unlock trillions of dollars in value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recent cuts of $60 billion in US foreign aid</strong> have created a significant unmet gap. USAID's closure is estimated to lead to 14 million deaths by 2030, alongside increases in infectious disease burdens, disability, severe malnutrition, pandemic risks, and lost human capital.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Opportunity and Risk</h3>
                <p><strong>Leveraging AI, low and middle-income countries could "leapfrog" traditional stages of development.</strong> Mobile money in Kenya demonstrates this power: M-Pesa leveraged high mobile phone penetration to provide a new model for banking access, increasing financial inclusion for tens of millions of people. Today, 80% of Kenyans use mobile money.</p>

                <p><strong>Conversely, without active support, developing economies may lag further.</strong> Government preparation is weak - South and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa recently ranked last in a government AI readiness index. Talent, compute access, high-quality datasets, and data centers are all concentrated in high-income countries.</p>

                <h3>Historical Precedents</h3>
                <p>History shows that without a clear driver and coordinated action, complex innovations in the developing world risk languishing or taking decades to drive uptake. However, there are successful examples:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GAVI's Advanced Market Commitments</strong> drove widespread adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine an estimated decade earlier than would have occurred otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Green Revolution</strong> funded by Ford and Rockefeller Foundations drove dramatic reductions in poverty and infant mortality through introducing new farming technologies.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="need" class="section">
                <h2>The Need</h2>
                
                <p><strong>We urgently need a new model for launching AI-enabled, evidence-based development interventions â€“ deployed at national scale.</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Many non-profits and developing-world governments aren't resourced</strong> to fully capture this opportunity. While NGOs recognize AI's promise, many lack the technical resources to operationalize AI at national scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Some interventions will require new regulatory or policy frameworks</strong> to enable national-scale change in education and healthcare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful, catalytic investment is needed.</strong> Today, over half of grants for AI and social impact efforts are less than $250,000, and many philanthropies don't yet account for AI in their strategic priorities.</li>
                    <li><strong>We need a cross-sectoral team</strong> to ensure end-to-end efforts from upstream challenges to last-mile delivery become a reality.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="big-bets" class="section">
                <h2>Big Bets</h2>
                
                <p>To maximize the likelihood of this upside case - we must identify, prioritize, and act on big bets now.</p>

                <p>We have evaluated approximately 30 high-potential interventions against their scale, evidence base, cost-effectiveness, tractability, and where AI is a key unlock. The highest priority interventions are moving forward in a rigorous vetting process.</p>

                <p><strong>Weather forecasting appears particularly impactful and tractable</strong> with potential to be delivered to tens of millions of farmers at extremely low marginal cost:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Impactful:</strong> AI models provide greater accuracy than traditional regional models, offer more precise forecasts, and unlock new types like seasonal predictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Marginal costs are low (a few cents per SMS) with high expected benefit ratio at scale</li>
                    <li><strong>Tractable:</strong> Pilots are already demonstrating early successes</li>
