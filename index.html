                    <p><strong>We're at an inflection point in global development and AI ‚Äì the next two years may have an outsized effect on the next century of impact.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>Today's AI applications predominantly focus on advanced economies. Access and applications in LMICs have been largely neglected. Exciting work is happening to develop LMIC-focused interventions, but it's often in pilot stage and more resources are needed to bring this work to scale.</p>

                <p>Leveraging AI, low & middle-income countries could "leapfrog" traditional stages of development and drive massive efficiencies. Mobile money in Kenya demonstrates this power: M-Pesa leveraged high mobile phone penetration to offer a new model for banking access, increasing financial inclusion for 30M+ people. Today, 80% of Kenyans use mobile money.</p>

                <h3>Key Opportunity Areas</h3>

                <div class="sector-card">
                    <h4>üåæ Downstream Agriculture</h4>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> There are 475 million small-scale farmers globally, 64% of whom live on less than $1500 annually. These farmers face increasingly complex decisions amid climate variability.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI opportunity:</strong> AI tools can help farmers increase crop yields, generating billions of dollars of income. AI improves weather forecasting accuracy and reduces costs compared to traditional extension programs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sector-card">
                    <h4>üè• Downstream Health</h4>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Over half the global population is not fully covered by essential health services, and 60% of deaths in LMICs from conditions requiring health care occur due to poor quality care.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI opportunity:</strong> AI can meaningfully increase healthcare treatment standards by improving diagnostics & treatment quality and democratizing access to care.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sector-card">
                    <h4>üìö Education</h4>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> 617M students fail to meet minimum proficiency levels in reading & math, and teachers are stretched thin with large classes and limited training.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI opportunity:</strong> AI could reduce educational attainment gaps by cost-effectively scaling evidence-backed tactics including personalized learning and frequent feedback.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sector-card">
                    <h4>üö® Humanitarian Response</h4>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> ~30% of the global population lacks early-warning coverage for severe weather, leading to widespread, preventable loss of life and assets.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI opportunity:</strong> AI stands to improve speed, accuracy, and scale of humanitarian response through better weather prediction and damage assessments.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <p><strong>Weather forecasting for smallholder farmers appears particularly impactful and tractable,</strong> with potential to be delivered to tens of millions of farmers at extremely low marginal cost:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Impactful:</strong> AI models provide greater accuracy than traditional regional models, offer more precise forecasts, and unlock new types of predictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Marginal costs are low (a few cents per SMS message) with high expected benefit ratio</li>
                    <li><strong>Tractable:</strong> Pilots are already demonstrating early successes</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="case-study">
                    <h4>Case Study: AI-Enabled Weather Forecasts for Smallholder Farmers</h4>
                    <p>Delivering tailored forecasts to smallholder farmers can have transformative economic impacts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Farmers in Benin and Colombia saw $100-350/year in financial benefit via SMS forecasts</li>
                        <li>Indian farmers gained ~$334m through improved seasonal rainfall forecasts</li>
                        <li>Forecasts can be delivered for pennies per farmer via SMS ($0.00019 in India, $0.03 in Ethiopia)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>AI can generate more accurate, scalable forecasts across multiple variables and is cheaper to run than traditional forecasts requiring supercomputing power.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> People in LMICs face enormous gaps in healthcare access and quality. Over half the global population (about 4.5 billion people) was not fully covered by essential health services as of 2021, and there is expected to be a global shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030.</p>

                <p><strong>In the near to medium term, high potential areas include:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI for TB medical imaging/screening:</strong> Strong evidence supporting accuracy of Computer Aided Detection of chest X-rays for TB. ~3.1M TB cases go undiagnosed annually due to diagnostic gaps</li>
                    <li><strong>AI for mental health:</strong> Potential for rules-constrained chatbots to help fill massive gaps in mental health services, though fully generative AI therapists remain too risky at this stage</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical validation needed:</strong> Most results come from simulations or small pilots. More evidence needed on integration into LMIC clinical settings with limited digital infrastructure</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Models are becoming more capable, but require investments in clinical validation prior to scaling in LMICs. While technology appears promising, more evidence is needed on effective integration into clinical settings with limited digital infrastructure.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Traditional program evaluation in LMICs is expensive and slow, requiring specialists and large teams. This delays the ability to identify needs, assess effectiveness, and adapt programs.</p>

                <p><strong>AI Opportunity for End-to-End M&E:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LLMs advise on evaluation design</li>
                    <li>AI voice agents and chatbots collect data through phones in local languages</li>
                    <li>AI tools clean, analyze, and report findings</li>
                    <li>Could dramatically lower costs and increase quality of evaluations</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> There's no clear market failure here ‚Äì private incentives might drive this technology forward. Phone-based data collection using AI is largely untested in high-poverty regions, and many poorest households lack phone access.</p>

                <p>We've identified hypotheses that apply across sectors for further consideration in the next phase of analysis:</p>

                <h3>Product Vision & Roadmap</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Think big but start small:</strong> Identify biggest overall opportunity areas and build a roadmap that stacks products over time, starting with near-term wins</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize user adoption:</strong> Leading indicators are more immediately measurable than multi-year RCTs, crucial amidst rapid AI change</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance breadth vs depth:</strong> Consider tradeoffs between maximizing product reach and improving outcomes for smaller user groups</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Paths to Scale / Demand Drivers</h3>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li><strong>Governments as key path:</strong> Focus on tractability concerns and potential upsides to drive demand and scale</li>
                    <li><strong>Competition from free LLMs:</strong> Alternative demand drivers (institutions, governments) may be more tractable, or partnerships with AI Labs</li>
